# Liam Kronman and Sofiane Larbi's Mathematical Project
Creating an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** through the lens of calculus and precalculus.

## How to Run Our Project
First, make sure you have python3 installed on your computer. It can be downloaded [here] (https://www.python.org).  

Then type this line of code into your terminal, in the same directory that you have cloned this repository, to download necessary dataset packages:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Finally, run our primary python file in your terminal with this line:

`python3 mnist_nn.py`  


## What is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)?
Imagine you have a bunch of images of dogs and cats, and you want to develop a program that will determine which images are of dogs and which are of cats. This may be harder than you think. Comparing the corresponding pixels of different images to a sort of "platonic ideal" of a dog or a cat is impractical, not only because the images might be of different dimensions, but also because if the pictured pet is not in the *exact* same position as your model cat/dog, you will probably get an incorrect output. For problems like these, that require reverse engineering the categories of various inputs, building an **ANN** may be the most effective solution.  
An **ANN** is a series of layers ()
